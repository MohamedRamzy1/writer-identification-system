\emph{Classical approaches} can be used to build a very robust writer identification system. In this work, we adopt different \emph{texture descriptors} as feature extractors. We show that \emph{LBP} features are simple yet powerful feature extractor for handwriting encoding. Also, we discuss the performance of different classifiers and illustrate that \emph{SVM} offers the best consistent performance. We, also, introduced the idea of dividing the form into lines and taking the majority vote, which greatly improves the performance in our test environment, because of small test cases. \\
This work can be improved in the following ways :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Improve \emph{preprocessor} to handle different illuminations and perform color correction.
    \item Expand \emph{LBP} features to include more than $8$ neighbors.
    \item Try to ensemble multiple classifiers output for better and more stable performance.
\end{enumerate}
